Welcome to `mindgym` ‚Äî a personal collection of algorithmic coding challenges, I play with in free time. 
They are primarily sourced from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), which I solve from time to time for fun and to stay sharp and explore different approaches to simple problem-solving.

This repository serves as a notebook for exploring data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. Problems are neatly organized into folders by category for easy browsing.
